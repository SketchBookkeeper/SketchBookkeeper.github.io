Hello, my name is Paul Allen. I've been a Web Developer since 2015. I like working in a variety of technologies, but tend to use PHP, JavaScript and CSS in most my work.

This is my blog where I can record things I learned. My purpose in doing this is not only share with others but also have this information for my future self.

You can get in touch with me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/paulallen_io).

My Projects:

[Note Manager](https://resource-manager-f661c.firebaseapp.com/#/)

[tab-accordion.js](https://github.com/SketchBookkeeper/tab-accordion-js)

[Gutenberg Animation Block](https://wordpress.org/plugins/animation-block/)
