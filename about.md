Hello, my name is Paul Allen. I've been a Web Developer since 2015. I like working in a variety of technologies, but tend to use PHP, JavaScript and CSS in most my work.

This is my blog where I can explore ideas and mostly record things I learned. My purpose in doing this is not only share with others but also have this information for my future self.
